    "&emsp;A prominent restaurant enterpreneur in UK that runs restaurants serving Italian, American and Asian dishes thinks of opening more restaurants in Greater London area to increase business coverage. London is known for its vivid cuisine scene and there is abundance of the restaurants and food joints satisfying all tastes. The problem is where to open and which restaurant to open? For instance, it would be unwise to open Italian restaurant in the area where there are already many Italian restaurant open, particularly if they have high rating. It will be hard to compete and may cause monetary losses. \n",
    "<br>&emsp;Another factor for decision is population/housing density - suburban district oftentimes are dominated by the houses for 1 family and can be charecterized by the low population density. Such districts are not able to support many small businesses - there will be not enough clients to achieve profite. In such areas many small businesses tend to concentrate in the malls, that attract people from the whole neighborhood. Opening restaurant in malls adjucent to subruban districts can be a viable option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enterpreneur turns to data scientits and asks to provide data-based answers for the <b>two main questions</b>:\n",
    "1. Which Greater London areas are the best to open restaurant(s)?\n",
    "2. Which cuisine(s) are the best option to open in the identified areas?\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Optional question</b> that we will try to find answer for is what price policy of new restaurant might be the most successful in a given neighboordhood. \n"

    "&emsp;Greater London Area that will be studying has 32 local government districts called <b>borough</b> plus special district of City of London. Each borough is divided by <b>wards</b> which serve as primary electoral geographical unit. We will use wards as a proxy for the neighborhood. We will exclude City of London from the analysis an concentrate on all other areas of inner and outer London.\n",
    "<br>&emsp;For this project we will utilize following datasets:</br>\n",
    "1. [Greater London Area (GLA) Land Area and Population Density, Ward and Borough](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/land-area-and-population-density-ward-and-borough). This open dataset is based on the census from 2011 with some updated data from 2016, as well as projection of population till year 2050. We will use predicted for 2021 data on total population, population density, area. It is clear that population density is population divided by area. At this stage of the project we can not yet make decision which parameter exactly we will be using. We want to discriminate between densely and sparsely populated areas.\n",
    "2. [Postcode directory of London](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/postcode-directory-for-london). This data contains information on postcodes of wards and their coordinates. There are several sets of coordinates for each ward (corresponding to many postcodes). We will perform simple averaging of coordinates to find proxy for the ward center.\n",
    "3. Foursquare API to fetch infomation about venues in each of the wards. We will use coordinates obtained from the dataset #2. We will be extracting information about type of the venue and potentially reviews of venues. \n",
    "4. Optionally we will be looking at the [wellbeing of neighborhood/wards](https://data.london.gov.uk/london-ward-well-being-scores/) to identify most appropriate price range of proposed restaurant. "
